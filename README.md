# Exchanger
This is a student's project created with Meteor.

The idea of the project is making a place where people can interact each other with the goal of selling and buying their stuff.
In summary, it's a virtual market with no direct incoming from the users exchanges. Exchanger only pretends to connect those people in an easy and confortable way.
